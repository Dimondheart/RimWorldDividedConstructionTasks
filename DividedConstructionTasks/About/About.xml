  <name>[A17] Divided Construction Tasks</name>
  <author>Bryan Bettis</author>
  <description>Divides construction tasks into 3 categories: Maintenance (repairing, roofing, etc.), Construction (building new structures/components), and Demolition (deconstructing things and uninstalling/relocating furniture.) Maintenance and Demolition can be performed by any pawn able to use the construction skill. Resetting traps has been moved from hauling to maintenance, and refueling things is in both maintenance and hauling.</description>
